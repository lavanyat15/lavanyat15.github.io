# Overview
### Visualise and Analyse Energy consumption

#### Analysis Goals : 

1. Analyse sub-metered household data. <br>
2. Explore visualizations of the data and then build predictive models that will demonstrate how much power each area could use in a given 30 day period.<br>
3. Also provide the client with five energy savings suggestions based on insights that you glean from your analysis.<br>

Code, Visualizations and Report can be found in Github link below.
