# Overview
### The task was to identify which customer attributes relate significantly to customer default rates and to build a predictive model one can use to better classify potential customers as being ‘at-risk’. Used machine learning regression methods in Python for this task.



## Project Goals
### Use the demographic data to determine:
#### 1. How much credit should customers be allowed - Regression 
#### 2. Should a potential customer be approved for credit ( Will the customer potentially Default / Not Default) - Classification

```
Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Models : SVR, RandomForest Regressor, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier

```

#### EDA and Model code can be found in [GitHub Page](https://github.com/lavanyat15/DataScience-Code)
